While significant progress has been made in mapping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small (<10 bp) insertion/deletions (indels), the annotation of larger structural variants has been less comprehensive. It is still unclear to what extent a typical genome differs from the reference assembly, and the analysis of the genomes sequenced to date have shown varying results for copy number variation (CNV) and inversions. RESULTS: We have combined computational re-analysis of existing whole genome sequence data with novel microarray-based analysis, and detect 12,178 structural variants covering 40.6 Mb that were not reported in the initial sequencing of the first published personal genome. We estimate a total non-SNP variation content of 48.8 Mb in a single genome. Our results indicate that this genome differs from the consensus reference sequence by approximately 1.2% when considering indels/CNVs, 0.1% by SNPs and approximately 0.3% by inversions. The structural variants impact 4,867 genes, and >24% of structural variants would not be imputed by SNP-association. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a large number of structural variants have been unreported in the individual genomes published to date. This significant extent and complexity of structural variants, as well as the growing recognition of their medical relevance, necessitate they be actively studied in health-related analyses of personal genomes.

By visual inspection of over a 100 Mb of genome to which next generation sequence data from 17 inbred mouse strains had been aligned, followed by PCR and Sanger-based sequencing, we identify and interpret 21 paired-end mapping (PEM) patterns. These PEM patterns reveal a greater diversity and complexity in SVs than previously recognised.

We found micro-deletions and micro-insertions at SV breakpoints ranging from 1 to 289 base pairs and SNPs that extended micro-homology associated with SV formation. An integrative approach using experimental analyses to train computational SV calling is essential for the accurate resolution of the architecture of SVs. We find considerable complexity in SV formation; about a quarter of SV in the mouse is made of a complex mixture of deletion, insertion, inversion and copy number gain.

Here, we describe the utility of genome-wide SNP analysis in the direct detection of extended homozygosity and structural genomic variation. We use this approach to assess the frequency of genomic alterations resulting from the lymphoblast immortalization and culture processes commonly used in cell repositories. We have assayed 408 804 SNPs in 276 DNA samples extracted from Epstein-Barr virus immortalized cell lines, which were derived from lymphocytes of elderly neurologically normal subjects. These data reveal extended homozygosity (contiguous tracts >5 Mb) in 9.5% (26/272) and 340 structural genomic alterations in 182 (66.9%) DNA samples assessed, 66% of which did not overlap with previously described structural variations. Examination of DNA extracted directly from the blood of 30 of these subjects confirmed all examined instances of extended homozygosity (6/6), 75% of structural genomic alteration <5 Mb in size (12/16) and 13% (1/8) of structural genomic alteration >5 Mb in size. These data suggest that structural genomic variation is a common phenomenon in the general population. While a proportion of this variability may be caused or its relative abundance altered by the immortalization and clonal process this will have only a minor effect on genotype and allele frequencies in a large cohort.

Following from the Pilot Phase, in which we established the key principles underlying the project design, we now report on the genomes of 1,092 individuals drawn from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole- genome and exome targeted sequencing. By developing methodologies to combine information across multiple algorithms and diverse data sources we provide an integrated and validated haplotype map of 38 million SNPs, 1.4 million indels and over 14 thousand larger deletions. We show how individuals from different populations have different profiles of rare and common variants and that low-frequency variants show elevated geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection.
By measuring the excess of rare alleles, we show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, and that rare- variant load varies substantially across biological pathways. We show that each individual harbours hundreds of rare, non-coding variants, such as transcription-factor-motif disrupting changes at conserved sites. This resource, which captures up to 98% of variants at 1% frequency in populations of medical genetics focus, enables imputation of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.','Read depth and paired-end mapping,Probe signal intensity,Genotyping,Split read mapping,Paired-end mapping,Other,Merging,Probe signal intensity,Paired-end mapping,Read depth,Genotyping','Genome STRiP,Genome STRiP, Beagle, Thunder,Pindel,DELLY,BreakDancerMax1.1,CNVnator 0.2.2,Beagle, Thunder','Sequencing,SNP array,Sequencing,Sequencing,Sequencing,PCR,Merging,Oligo aCGH,Sequencing,Sequencing,Sequencing','Illumina Genome Analyzer,Genome Analyzer II,Genome Analyzer IIx,HiSeq 2000,Illumina Omni 2.5,Illumina Genome Analyzer,Genome Analyzer II,Genome Analyzer IIx,HiSeq 2000,Illumina Genome Analyzer,Genome Analyzer II,Genome Analyzer IIx,HiSeq 2000,Illumina Genome Analyzer,Genome Analyzer II,Genome Analyzer IIx,HiSeq 2000,PTC-225 DNA Engine Tetrad Cycler (Biorad),Merging,Agilent 2x1M CGH Microarray,Illumina Genome Analyzer,Genome Analyzer II,Genome Analyzer IIx,HiSeq 2000,Illumina Genome Analyzer,Genome Analyzer II,Genome Analyzer IIx,HiSeq 2000,Illumina Genome Analyzer,Genome Analyzer II,Genome Analyzer IIx,HiSeq 2000,Roche 454 GS-FLX+,AB SOLiD','GRCh37,GRCh38','GCA_000001405.15,GCF_000001405.13');

Furthermore, by correlation with known trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified 30 loci with CNVs that are candidates for influencing disease susceptibility.

The deeper coverage allows more functional variants to be identified for each person when compared to the low-pass sequencing in 1KGP. This set of whole-genome sequence data is expected to be the benchmark for evaluating the value of deep population-level sequencing versus low-pass sequencing, especially in populations that are poorly represented in population genetic studies.

However, the formidable size of the diploid human genome, approximately 6 gigabases, has prevented the routine application of sequencing methods to deciphering complete individual human genomes. To realize the full potential of genomics for human health, this limitation must be overcome. Here we report the DNA sequence of a diploid genome of a single individual, James D. Watson, sequenced to 7.4-fold redundancy in two months using massively parallel sequencing in picolitre-size reaction vessels. This sequence was completed in two months at approximately one-hundredth of the cost of traditional capillary electrophoresis methods. Comparison of the sequence to the reference genome led to the identification of 3.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 10,654 cause amino-acid substitution within the coding sequence. In addition, we accurately identified small-scale (2-40,000 base pair (bp)) insertion and deletion polymorphism as well as copy number variation resulting in the large-scale gain and loss of chromosomal segments ranging from 26,000 to 1.5 million base pairs. Overall, these results agree well with recent results of sequencing of a single individual by traditional methods. However, in addition to being faster and significantly less expensive, this sequencing technology avoids the arbitrary loss of genomic sequences inherent in random shotgun sequencing by bacterial cloning because it amplifies DNA in a cell-free system.

It was produced from 32 million random DNA fragments, sequenced by Sanger dideoxy technology and assembled into 4,528 scaffolds, comprising 2,810 million bases (Mb) of contiguous sequence with approximately 7.5-fold coverage for any given region. We developed a modified version of the Celera assembler to facilitate the identification and comparison of alternate alleles within this individual diploid genome. Comparison of this genome and the National Center for Biotechnology Information human reference assembly revealed more than 4.1 million DNA variants, encompassing 12.3 Mb. These variants (of which 1,288,319 were novel) included 3,213,401 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 53,823 block substitutions (2-206 bp), 292,102 heterozygous insertion/deletion events (indels)(1-571 bp), 559,473 homozygous indels (1-82,711 bp), 90 inversions, as well as numerous segmental duplications and copy number variation regions. Non-SNP DNA variation accounts for 22% of all events identified in the donor, however they involve 74% of all variant bases. This suggests an important role for non-SNP genetic alterations in defining the diploid genome structure. Moreover, 44% of genes were heterozygous for one or more variants. Using a novel haplotype assembly strategy, we were able to span 1.5 Gb of genome sequence in segments .200 kb, providing further precision to the diploid nature of the genome. These data depict a definitive molecular portrait of a diploid human genome that provides a starting point for future genome comparisons and enables an era of individualized genomic information.','Probe signal intensity,SNP genotyping analysis,SNP genotyping analysis,SNP genotyping analysis,SNP genotyping analysis,SNP genotyping analysis,SNP genotyping analysis,Probe signal intensity,SNP genotyping analysis,Sequence alignment,Merging','CNVFinder,CNAG,CNAG,CNVFinder,CNVFinder,dCHIP,dCHIP,CGH_Analytics_Software,QuantiSNP','Oligo aCGH,SNP array,SNP array,SNP array,SNP array,SNP array,SNP array,Oligo aCGH,SNP array,Sequencing,Merging','Not Reported,[Mapping250K_Sty] Affymetrix Mapping 250K Sty2 SNP Array,[Mapping250K_Nsp] Affymetrix Mapping 250K Nsp SNP Array,[Mapping250K_Nsp] Affymetrix Mapping 250K Nsp SNP Array,[Mapping250K_Sty] Affymetrix Mapping 250K Sty2 SNP Array,[Mapping250K_Sty] Affymetrix Mapping 250K Sty2 SNP Array,[Mapping250K_Nsp] Affymetrix Mapping 250K Nsp SNP Array,Not Reported,Illumina HumanHap650Y Genotyping BeadChip,Sanger Sequencing,Not Reported','GRCh37,GRCh37.p13,GRCh38,NCBI36','GCA_000001405.14,GCA_000001405.15,GCF_000001405.12,GCF_000001405.13');

Applying a two-stage high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization approach to analyse 50 healthy Caucasian males from northern France, we discovered 2208 copy number variants (CNVs) detected by more than one consecutive probe. These clustered into 1469 CNV regions (CNVRs), of which 721 are thought to be novel. The majority of these are small (median size 4.4 kb) and most have common boundaries, with a coefficient of variation less than 0.1 for 83% of endpoints in those observed in multiple samples. Only 6% of the CNVRs analysed showed evidence of both copy number losses and gains at the same site. A further 6089 variants were detected by single probes: 48% of these were observed in more than one individual. In total, 2570 genes were seen to intersect variants: 1284 in novel loci. Genes involved in differentiation and development were significantly over-represented and approximately half of the genes identified feature in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database. The biological importance of many genes affected, along with the well-conserved nature of the majority of the CNVs, suggests that they could have important implications for phenotype and, thus, be useful for association studies of complex diseases.','Probe signal intensity','CGH_Analytics_Software','Oligo aCGH','Agilent-015366 Custom Human 244K CGH Microarray','GRCh37,GRCh37.p13,GRCh38,NCBI35','GCA_000001405.14,GCA_000001405.15,GCF_000001405.11,GCF_000001405.13');

Furthermore, in two prospective studies men with LOY at blood sampling had greater risk for incident AD diagnosis during follow-up time (hazard ratio HR=6.80, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=2.16-21.43, AD events=140, p=0.0011). Thus, LOY in blood is associated with risks of both AD and cancer, suggesting a role of LOY in blood cells on disease processes in other tissues, possibly via defective immunosurveillance. As a male-specific risk factor, LOY might explain why males on average live shorter lives than females.','SNP genotyping analysis',null,'SNP array','Illumina Human610-Quad v1.0 BeadChip','GRCh37,GRCh38,NCBI36','GCA_000001405.15,GCF_000001405.12,GCF_000001405.13');

Relative increase of sequencing coverage was used as a confirmation tool for copy number gains. 2. BACs less than 40 kb were considered as significantly short. The co-localization of two or more short BACs was considered as the candidate region of amplification. 3. Putative structural variations were detected with microarrays (Illumina BeadChip 370K, 610K, and Agilent 24M aCGH; Supplementary Methods).

Despite new advances, significant biases remain in terms of CNP discovery and genotyping. We developed a novel method based on single channel intensity data and benchmarked against copy numbers determined from sequencing read-depth to successfully obtain CNP genotypes for 1489 CNPs from 487 human DNA samples from diverse ethnic backgrounds. This customized microarray was enriched for segmental duplication-rich regions and novel insertions of sequences not represented in the reference genome assembly or on standard single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray platforms. We observe that CNPs in segmental duplications are more likely to be population differentiated than CNPs in unique regions (p = 0.015) and that bi-allelic CNPs show greater stratification when compared to frequency-matched SNPs (p = 0.0026). Although bi-allelic CNPs show a strong correlation of copy number with flanking SNP genotypes, the majority of multi-copy CNPs do not (40% with r &gt;0.8). We selected a subset of CNPs for further characterization in 1873 additional samples from 62 populations; this revealed striking population-differentiated structural variants in genes of clinical significance such as the OCLN gene, a tight junction protein involved in hepatitis C viral entry. Our new microarray design allows these variants to be rapidly tested for disease association and our results suggest that CNPs (especially those not in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs) may have contributed disproportionately to human diversity and selection.','Probe signal intensity,Probe signal intensity','Agilent Genomic Workbench ADM2 algorithm,Agilent Genomic Workbench ADM2 algorithm','Oligo aCGH,Oligo aCGH','Agilent Eichler Human CNP 180K v2.1,Agilent Eichler Human CNP 180K v3.0','GRCh37,GRCh37.p13,GRCh38,GRCh38.p2,NCBI36','GCA_000001405.14,GCA_000001405.15,GCA_000001405.17,GCF_000001405.12,GCF_000001405.13,GCF_000001405.28');

Here, we applied TranspoSeq, a computational framework that identifies retrotransposon insertions from sequencing data, to whole-genomes from 200 tumor/normal pairs across 11 tumor types as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer Project. In addition to novel germline polymorphisms, we find 810 somatic retrotransposon insertions primarily in lung squamous, head and neck, colorectal and endometrial carcinomas. Many somatic retrotransposon insertions occur in known cancer genes. We find that high somatic retrotransposition rates in tumors are associated with high rates of genomic rearrangement and somatic mutation. Finally, we developed TranspoSeq-Exome to interrogate an additional 767 tumor samples with hybrid-capture exome data and discover 35 novel somatic retrotransposon insertions into exonic regions, including an insertion into an exon of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. The results of this large-scale, comprehensive analysis of retrotransposon movement across tumor types suggest that somatic retrotransposon insertions may represent an important class of structural variation in cancer.','Split read mapping,Manual observation,Split read and paired-end mapping',null,'Sequencing,PCR,Sequencing','Not reported,Not reported,Not reported','GRCh37,GRCh38,GRCh38.p2','GCA_000001405.15,GCA_000001405.17,GCF_000001405.13,GCF_000001405.28');

Coding region of 1,675 annotated genes was affected by CNVs with the function enriched in defense response pathway. 28 functional genes affected by CNV were validated, including OsMADS56, BPH14, OsDCL2b and OsMADS30, suggesting the potential role of CNV on phenotypes. 41% conserved CNV genes are non-collinear compared to O. glaberrima. âCopy and pasteâ of genomic fragments accompany with transposon and double streak break (DSB) repair processes was one origin of them. Comprehensive analysis of mutational mechanisms that generate CNV suggested non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and mobile element insertion (MEI) as the major determinants cause rearrangement. &gt;80% CNVs are shared between species indicating that most of them are from the same gene pool, and predate the rice domestication or improvement.
