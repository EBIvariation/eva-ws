The first whole genome sequence of a grain sorghum is available, but additional genome sequences are required to study genome-wide and intraspecies variation for dissecting the genetic basis of these important traits and for tailor-designed breeding of this important C4 crop. We resequenced two sweet and one grain sorghum inbred lines, and identified a set of nearly 1,500 genes differentiating sweet and grain sorghum.

This algorithm incorporates multiple sources of information, including total signal intensity and allelic intensity ratio at each SNP marker, the distance between neighboring SNPs, the allele frequency of SNPs, and the pedigree information where available. We applied PennCNV to genotyping data generated for 112 HapMap individuals; on average, we detected approximately 27 CNVs for each individual with a median size of approximately 12 kb.

Whole genome analysis using massively parallel sequencing with multiple ultra-high resolution CGH arrays provides an opportunity to catalog highly accurate genomic variants of the reference DNA (NA10851). Using information on variants, we developed a new method, the CGH array referencefree algorithm (CARA), which can determine reference-unbiased absolute CNVs from any CGH array platform. The algorithm enables the removal and rescue of false positive and false negative CNVs, respectively, which appear due to the effects of genomic variants of the reference sample in raw CGH array experiments.

While significant progress has been made in mapping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small (<10 bp) insertion/deletions (indels), the annotation of larger structural variants has been less comprehensive. It is still unclear to what extent a typical genome differs from the reference assembly, and the analysis of the genomes sequenced to date have shown varying results for copy number variation (CNV) and inversions. RESULTS: We have combined computational re-analysis of existing whole genome sequence data with novel microarray-based analysis, and detect 12,178 structural variants covering 40.6 Mb that were not reported in the initial sequencing of the first published personal genome. We estimate a total non-SNP variation content of 48.8 Mb in a single genome. Our results indicate that this genome differs from the consensus reference sequence by approximately 1.2% when considering indels/CNVs, 0.1% by SNPs and approximately 0.3% by inversions. The structural variants impact 4,867 genes, and >24% of structural variants would not be imputed by SNP-association. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a large number of structural variants have been unreported in the individual genomes published to date. This significant extent and complexity of structural variants, as well as the growing recognition of their medical relevance, necessitate they be actively studied in health-related analyses of personal genomes. The new catalogue of structural variants generated for this genome provides a crucial resource for future comparison studies.','Paired-end mapping,Probe signal intensity,Probe signal intensity,SNP genotyping analysis,SNP genotyping analysis,Split read mapping,Probe signal intensity',null,'Sequencing,Oligo aCGH,SNP array,Oligo aCGH,Oligo aCGH,Sequencing,SNP array','Sanger Sequencing,Not Submitted,Not Submitted,Not Submitted,Sanger Sequencing,Not Submitted,Not Submitted','GRCh37.p13,GRCh38,GRCh37,NCBI36');

By visual inspection of over a 100 Mb of genome to which next generation sequence data from 17 inbred mouse strains had been aligned, followed by PCR and Sanger-based sequencing, we identify and interpret 21 paired-end mapping (PEM) patterns. These PEM patterns reveal a greater diversity and complexity in SVs than previously recognised. Analysis of breakpoint sequences at 261 SV sites revealed additional complexity at the nucleotide level of about a quarter of structural variants analysed. We found micro-deletions and micro-insertions at SV breakpoints ranging from 1 to 289 base pairs and SNPs that extended micro-homology associated with SV formation. An integrative approach using experimental analyses to train computational SV calling is essential for the accurate resolution of the architecture of SVs.

Here, we describe the utility of genome-wide SNP analysis in the direct detection of extended homozygosity and structural genomic variation. We use this approach to assess the frequency of genomic alterations resulting from the lymphoblast immortalization and culture processes commonly used in cell repositories. We have assayed 408 804 SNPs in 276 DNA samples extracted from Epstein-Barr virus immortalized cell lines, which were derived from lymphocytes of elderly neurologically normal subjects. These data reveal extended homozygosity (contiguous tracts >5 Mb) in 9.5% (26/272) and 340 structural genomic alterations in 182 (66.9%) DNA samples assessed, 66% of which did not overlap with previously described structural variations. Examination of DNA extracted directly from the blood of 30 of these subjects confirmed all examined instances of extended homozygosity (6/6), 75% of structural genomic alteration <5 Mb in size (12/16) and 13% (1/8) of structural genomic alteration >5 Mb in size. These data suggest that structural genomic variation is a common phenomenon in the general population. While a proportion of this variability may be caused or its relative abundance altered by the immortalization and clonal process this will have only a minor effect on genotype and allele frequencies in a large cohort.

By measuring the excess of rare alleles, we show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, and that rare- variant load varies substantially across biological pathways. We show that each individual harbours hundreds of rare, non-coding variants, such as transcription-factor-motif disrupting changes at conserved sites.

In addition, the composition of populations in the 1KGP is not complete, despite the extension of the study design to more than 2,500 samples from more than 20 population groups.

The deeper coverage allows more functional variants to be identified for each person when compared to the low-pass sequencing in 1KGP. This set of whole-genome sequence data is expected to be the benchmark for evaluating the value of deep population-level sequencing versus low-pass sequencing, especially in populations that are poorly represented in population genetic studies.

However, the formidable size of the diploid human genome, approximately 6 gigabases, has prevented the routine application of sequencing methods to deciphering complete individual human genomes. To realize the full potential of genomics for human health, this limitation must be overcome. Here we report the DNA sequence of a diploid genome of a single individual, James D. Watson, sequenced to 7.4-fold redundancy in two months using massively parallel sequencing in picolitre-size reaction vessels. This sequence was completed in two months at approximately one-hundredth of the cost of traditional capillary electrophoresis methods. Comparison of the sequence to the reference genome led to the identification of 3.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, of which 10,654 cause amino-acid substitution within the coding sequence. In addition, we accurately identified small-scale (2-40,000 base pair (bp)) insertion and deletion polymorphism as well as copy number variation resulting in the large-scale gain and loss of chromosomal segments ranging from 26,000 to 1.5 million base pairs. Overall, these results agree well with recent results of sequencing of a single individual by traditional methods. However, in addition to being faster and significantly less expensive, this sequencing technology avoids the arbitrary loss of genomic sequences inherent in random shotgun sequencing by bacterial cloning because it amplifies DNA in a cell-free system. As a result, we further demonstrate the acquisition of novel human sequence, including novel genes not previously identified by traditional genomic sequencing. This is the first genome sequenced by next-generation technologies. Therefore it is a pilot for the future challenges of ''personalized genome sequencing''.','Probe signal intensity,Probe signal intensity,Probe signal intensity,Read depth','CGH_Analytics_Software,CGH_Analytics_Software','Oligo aCGH,Sequencing,Oligo aCGH,Oligo aCGH','Nimblegen HD2 Microarray,Agilent-014584 Human Genome 244K CGH Microarray (Alpha Test),Agilent-014584 Human Genome 244K CGH Microarray (Alpha Test),Roche 454','GRCh37.p13,GRCh37,GRCh38,NCBI36');

We developed a modified version of the Celera assembler to facilitate the identification and comparison of alternate alleles within this individual diploid genome. Comparison of this genome and the National Center for Biotechnology Information human reference assembly revealed more than 4.1 million DNA variants, encompassing 12.3 Mb. These variants (of which 1,288,319 were novel) included 3,213,401 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 53,823 block substitutions (2-206 bp), 292,102 heterozygous insertion/deletion events (indels)(1-571 bp), 559,473 homozygous indels (1-82,711 bp), 90 inversions, as well as numerous segmental duplications and copy number variation regions. Non-SNP DNA variation accounts for 22% of all events identified in the donor, however they involve 74% of all variant bases. This suggests an important role for non-SNP genetic alterations in defining the diploid genome structure. Moreover, 44% of genes were heterozygous for one or more variants.

Both members of the 38 MZ-pair were accidentally included due to initial misclassification of zygosity (based on similarity questions). We aimed to investigate occurrence of potential CNV differences between the members of the 38 pairs and thus to test the robustness of the assumption of 100% shared genetic variation in MZ in the classical twin model from the CNV perspective. We find that systemic CNV differences in MZ twins are rare with only one single finding validating with independent methodology. Interestingly, this CNV is a deletion located in the NRXN1 gene encoding Neurexin1 and there covers a small exon. NRXN1 is among the top genes for CNV involvement in development of schizophrenia, cognitive performance, autism and Tourette’s syndrome.

Applying a two-stage high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization approach to analyse 50 healthy Caucasian males from northern France, we discovered 2208 copy number variants (CNVs) detected by more than one consecutive probe. These clustered into 1469 CNV regions (CNVRs), of which 721 are thought to be novel. The majority of these are small (median size 4.4 kb) and most have common boundaries, with a coefficient of variation less than 0.1 for 83% of endpoints in those observed in multiple samples. Only 6% of the CNVRs analysed showed evidence of both copy number losses and gains at the same site. A further 6089 variants were detected by single probes: 48% of these were observed in more than one individual. In total, 2570 genes were seen to intersect variants: 1284 in novel loci. Genes involved in differentiation and development were significantly over-represented and approximately half of the genes identified feature in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database.

Late-onset, sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common and lethal neurodegenerative disorder and many germline inherited variants have been found to influence the risk of developing AD. Our previous results show that a fundamentally different genetic variant, i.e. lifetime-acquired loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in blood cells, is associated with all-cause mortality, an increased risk of non-hematological tumors and that LOY could be induced by tobacco smoking. We tested here a hypothesis whether men with LOY are more susceptible to AD and show that LOY is associated with AD in three independent studies of different types. In a case-control study, males with AD diagnosis had higher degree of LOY mosaicism (adjusted odds ratio=2.80, p=0.0184, AD events=606). Furthermore, in two prospective studies men with LOY at blood sampling had greater risk for incident AD diagnosis during follow-up time (hazard ratio HR=6.80, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=2.16-21.43, AD events=140, p=0.0011). Thus, LOY in blood is associated with risks of both AD and cancer, suggesting a role of LOY in blood cells on disease processes in other tissues, possibly via defective immunosurveillance.

To confirm reliable large deletions in diploid GA sequencing, three criteria had to be met: (1) relative coverage drops compared to those of the flanking regions; (2) the existence of stretched paired-end sequence; and (3) the loss of heterozygous SNPs under the regions. Relative increase of sequencing coverage was used as a confirmation tool for copy number gains. 2. BACs less than 40 kb were considered as significantly short. The co-localization of two or more short BACs was considered as the candidate region of amplification. 3. Putative structural variations were detected with microarrays (Illumina BeadChip 370K, 610K, and Agilent 24M aCGH; Supplementary Methods). For Illumina BeadChips, normalized bead intensity data and genotype calls were obtained with Illumina BeadStudio 3.1 software.

Despite new advances, significant biases remain in terms of CNP discovery and genotyping. We developed a novel method based on single channel intensity data and benchmarked against copy numbers determined from sequencing read-depth to successfully obtain CNP genotypes for 1489 CNPs from 487 human DNA samples from diverse ethnic backgrounds. This customized microarray was enriched for segmental duplication-rich regions and novel insertions of sequences not represented in the reference genome assembly or on standard single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray platforms. We observe that CNPs in segmental duplications are more likely to be population differentiated than CNPs in unique regions (p = 0.015) and that bi-allelic CNPs show greater stratification when compared to frequency-matched SNPs (p = 0.0026). Although bi-allelic CNPs show a strong correlation of copy number with flanking SNP genotypes, the majority of multi-copy CNPs do not (40% with r &gt;0.8). We selected a subset of CNPs for further characterization in 1873 additional samples from 62 populations; this revealed striking population-differentiated structural variants in genes of clinical significance such as the OCLN gene, a tight junction protein involved in hepatitis C viral entry. Our new microarray design allows these variants to be rapidly tested for disease association and our results suggest that CNPs (especially those not in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs) may have contributed disproportionately to human diversity and selection.','Probe signal intensity,Probe signal intensity','Agilent Genomic Workbench ADM2 algorithm,Agilent Genomic Workbench ADM2 algorithm','Oligo aCGH,Oligo aCGH','Agilent Eichler Human CNP 180K v2.1,Agilent Eichler Human CNP 180K v3.0','GRCh37.p13,GRCh38,NCBI36,GRCh38.p2,GRCh37,GRCh38.p2');
